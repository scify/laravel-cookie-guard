The `close.svg` and `cookie.svg` images that are in this directory are not directly used in the application. Instead, we
use the svg content directly in the html file. This is done to avoid the overhead of loading the images.

The `close.svg` image is used in the `close` button in the `cookie-banner` component. The `cookie.svg` image is used in
the `cookie-banner` component to show the cookie icon.

The 2 images are stored here for reference purposes.
